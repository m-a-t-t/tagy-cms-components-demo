Tagy CMS Components demo
========================

AngularJS components demo for modern approach to CMS, inspired by HTML5. CMS inside HTML = HMS


Traditional CMS engines render web pages on the server. Tagy CMS reimagined this with modern, client-side approach and HTML tag extentions.

To make a website editable you just use plain HTML and insert Tagy attributes. Annotated HTML is consumed by Tagy client side editor. Now you can edit parts of this page inline - by clicking on elements. When complete Tagy client-side editor returnes updated HTML document. 

But each site has some global elements like navigation or footer that you want to update from one place. Tagy syncs marked elements across all pages within domain.

This solution eliminates server-side templating and simplifies website development. HTML documents have tags with all information needed to edit and update content on the site. Editing content is also faster and easier with live preview at all times.
